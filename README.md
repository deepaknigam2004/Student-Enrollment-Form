# Student-Enrollment-Form
The Student Enrollment Form collects data including Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, and Enrollment-Date, which are stored in the STUDENT-TABLE of the SCHOOL-DB database. The Roll-No serves as the primary key, uniquely identifying each student record to ensure data integrity and avoid duplication.
