# Student-Enrollment-Form

## Description  
This project is a web-based **Student Enrollment Form** designed to input and store student data into the `STUDENT-TABLE` of the `SCHOOL-DB` database using **JsonPowerDB**.  
It captures the following fields:

- Roll-No *(Primary Key)*  
- Full-Name  
- Class  
- Birth-Date  
- Address  
- Enrollment-Date  

The **Roll-No** uniquely identifies each student record in the database to ensure data integrity and avoid duplication.
